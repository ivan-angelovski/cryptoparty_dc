# Code for DC CryptoParty Agenda | January 29, 2019
## Opting Out
**Bring your phone, tablet, computer, or pen/paper to follow along!**

_Code for DC CryptoParty Ethos_
> Privacy is a fundamental human right. It is recognized in many countries to be as central to individual human dignity and social values as Freedom of Association and Freedom of Speech. Privacy is where we draw the line on how far a society can intrude into our personal lives. It is user-defined and varies between individuals. You are the steward of your identity. You are the only person who has the right to disclose your personal story.

**Remember** to join `#cryptoparty` on [Code for DC's Slack](https://codefordc.org/resources/slack.html). If you plan on eating pizza 🍕, remember to [RSVP on meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Code-for-DC/events/).

## Today's Session
#### Facilitated by [Ivan Angelovski](#)
#### #OptOut
We’ll discuss on how not to be a part of the mass surveillance, targeted marketing campaigns, being a product instead of a user. 
Takeout from today’s session: 
Increased awareness of how tech companies can track you
How can you avoid that 
Stomach full of pizza.

##### CHROME SETTINGS
(Borrowed from https://myshadow.org/how-to-increase-your-privacy-on-chrome)
Be aware that Chrome collects data. Chrome is a Google product, which means your data  - including your search history - lands up in the hands of Google. As such, you might want to consider using Firefox or Tor Browser instead.
That said, if you're using Chrome, here's how to get more control over your data.
 
Incognito mode
Chrome →  → Select "New Incognito Window" Incognito mode icon

Using Chrome's Incognito Mode means that when you close your browser, a number of traces created during the session are automatically cleared: your browser, search, web form and download histories, as well as cookies and temporary files.

Note:

What is saved and what deleted when you close the browser is already pre-defined - you can't customize 'private browsing mode' to to suit your own needs.
Only your browser history from this incognito session will be cleared. Your history from previous browsing sessions in 'normal mode' are unaffected.
Trackers in the websites you visit can still collect data about you, including you browser history.
Incognito mode does not give you anonymity on the internet.
 
Changing your default privacy settings
Customised Browsing
In Chrome, you have to open an Incognito Mode window on a session-by-session basis; you can't set it by default. 

But you can create your own default 'browsing mode', and set exactly what information will be deleted, and what saved, when you close Chrome.

You can also choose whether to by default allow or block trackers, plug-ins, and images (including ads and banners, which can also be trackers.)

Chrome →  → settings → click on Show more advanced settings at the very bottom of the page → privacy → check: Content settings

Settings for maximum control:

→ Cookies → check: Block sites from setting any data and check: Block third-party cookies and site data

→ Javascript → There are two options here.

If you already have an add-on like Privacy Badger or Scripsafe installed (that is, an add-on that allows you to control which sites can run code called scripts) -  check: Allow all sites to run JavaScript.
If you don't have one of these add-ons installed, check Do not allow any site to run JavaScript.
→ Plugins → check: Let me choose when to run plugin content
→ Location → check: Do not allow any site to track your physical location
→ Media → check: Do not allow sites to access your camera and microphone
→ Automatic Download → check: Do not allow any site to download multiple files automatically

Note:

Choosing to block all cookies and disable javascript can affect the functionality of some websites. You may find it easier to manage trackers using add-ons instead.
Your history will only be cleared when you close the browser.
The trackers in the websites you visit can still collect data about you, including you browser history (depending on the tracker).
 
Do not track
Chrome →  → settings → click on Show more advanced settings at the very bottom of the page → privacy → check Send a 'Do Not Track' request with your browsing traffic

When this box is checked, Chrome will send a Do Not Track request to each website you visit.

Note that trackers do not need to comply with your "Do Not Track" request. However, if you install the add-on Privacy Badger, it will automatically block trackers that ignore "Do Not Track" requests.


Tips for further controlling your data
Changing your default search engine
The default search engine in Chrome is Google.

There are, however, a number of good search engines out there that offer a lot more privacy. Privacy-enhancing search engines like DuckDuckGo, Searx, StartPage or Ixquick, do not collect your data traces, which means that you can keep your search history private.

Chrome makes you take two steps to change your default search engine:

Go to the website of the search engine you want:  duckduckgo.com, for example --> click on the box set Duck Duck go as your default search engine → follow the instructions
 
Then go to   → settings → search →  'Set which search engine is used when searching from the omnibox' (the URL bar) --> select DuckDuckGo
 

Clear your History regularly while browsing
Clear Browser History Chrome →   → history and recent tabs → history → clear browsing data → select the beginning of time and check: all the items you want to be cleared → clear browsing data

It's good to regularly clear your browsing history.

Even when you're in Incognito Mode, your history and cookies will not be deleted until you close the browser completely. In just one day you can build up quite a big history if you don't clear it as you go, and some trackers have access to this.

Install add-ons and extensions
There are some very effective pieces of software you can install to block trackers, encrypt your website connections, and stop spying ads from running.



##### FIREFOX
How to change your default privacy settings
Start here:

Firefox → Menu Icon Firefox (top right) → Preferences --> Privacy -->
 
Manual privacy setting Firefox

Tracking
→ check Tell sites that I do not want to be tracked

Your browser will tell every website you visit that you do not want to be tracked.

Note: Websites are, unfortunately, not required to respect this message, but it can work quite well in combination with Privacy Badger, which is designed to automatically block trackers that ignore Do Not Track requests.

 

History
Private Browsing Mode  Private Browser Firefox
'Private Browsing' allows you to browse the Internet without Firefox saving any information in your browser history. You can set Private Browsing by default, or you can use it only occasionally.

Setting private browsing by default can be done in two ways:

1.  Firefox → Menu Icon Firefox → Preferences → Privacy → select Never remember history

or
2. Firefox → Menu Icon Firefox → Preferences → Privacy → select use custom settings for history --> check: Always use private browsing mode

When you close Firefox, the following will be cleared: your browser, search, web form and download histories, as well as cookies and temporary files.

Note:

What will be saved and what deleted is already pre-defined - you can't customize 'private browsing mode' to to suit your own needs.
Your history will only be cleared when you close the browser
The trackers in the websites you visit can still collect data about you, including your browser history.
Private browsing excludes the files you download and the pages you bookmark. These are saved.
Private Browsing doesn't make you anonymous on the internet.
 

Using 'Private Browsing' occasionally
'Private Browsing' mode can also be used for a single window:

Open Firefox → Menu Icon Firefox→ New Private Window

 

Customised Browsing
Maybe you don't want Firefox to delete everything every time you close the browser, as it does in  Private Browsing mode. You can customise your privacy settings yourself, to create your own default browsing 'mode' - deciding exactly what information will be deleted, and what saved, when you close the browser.

Firefox → Menu Icon Firefox → Preferences --> Privacy -->

History → select use custom settings for history  → uncheck: Always use private browsing mode

uncheck: Remember my browsing and download history 

uncheck: Remember search and form history

check: Accept cookies from sites --> Accept third-party cookies: select Never --> Keep until: select I close Firefox. (see more about these options, below)

check: Clear historChange Setting for Clearing History Manually Firefoxy when Firefox closes  → Click on settings → check all the boxes that you do not want your browser to remember.  (see more about these options, below)
 

'Accept third-party cookies: Always / From visited / Never'

This allows you to choose whether to allow websites to set cookies in your browser.

Note:  If we choose the option 'Accept third-party cookies: Never' this might affect functionality of some websites, such as the login function. To enable these websites to work fully, click on exceptions and add the URL of the website to the list.

 

'Clear History when Firefox closes':

Clear History opens up an extended dialog box that allows you to decide exactly what is saved and what is deleted in your browser history when you close the browser.

Note:

As in Private Browsing mode, your history will only be cleared when you close the browser.
The trackers included the websites you visit can still collect data about you.
Clearing history does not make you anonymous on the Internet.
 

Location bar (the URL bar)
Location bar → uncheck History, Bookmarks and Open Tabs

When the boxes for History, Bookmarks and Open Tabs are checked, your browser not only stores in memory the websites you have visited, but also makes suggestions. For this kind of personalisation of your browser, Firefox needs to collect data about you. Unchecking these options means less data is collected.

 

Tips for further controlling your data
Change your default search engine
There are a number of good search engines out there that offer a lot more privacy than Google. Privacy-enhancing search engines like DuckDuckGo, Searx, StartPage or Ixquick, do not collect your data traces, which means that you can keep your search history private.

Firefox → Menu Icon Firefox → Preferences --> Search → select DuckDuckGo or another search engine. 
 

Clear your History regularly while browsing
Firefox → Menu Icon Firefox → History --> Clear recent history

It's good to regularly clear your browsing history. Even when you're in 'private browsing' mode, your history and cookies will not be deleted until you close the browser completely. In just one day you can build up quite a big history if you don't clear it as you go.
